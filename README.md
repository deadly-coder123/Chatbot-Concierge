## Overview 

- Many budget and chain hotels operate without a concierge but hotel patrons still want to know about local activities that they can go do in the local area.  Although the front desk staff want to be helpful, they are often busy, don’t live in the area or don’t share similar interests as the guests.  The hotel manager also may want the ability to send guests to local attractions that will result in a positive experience and will encourage a return stay.  Many activities that give a town or city character are free but there is no good resource to find these activities.
-  Since hotel guests are hesitant to download another app, we will build a mobile first website that can be accessed and use location services to show local activities tailored to the guest with 5 questions.  Our stretch goal is to use this to create an Alexa skill that could live in the hotel lobby and make suggestions to guests.  
- Data will be sourced from APIs and will also be cloud sourced with verification.  Backend access and authentication will be setup to approve new activities.
